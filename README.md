üåê Project: Hybrid Chat Application with ASP.NET MVC and Blazor Server
üìò Description:
A hybrid chat application built with ASP.NET MVC and Blazor Server, designed to showcase how modern UI technologies can be integrated into a traditional web architecture.

The solution leverages the robustness and structure of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for routing, project organization, and authentication, while using Blazor Server components to deliver real-time interactivity without full page reloads.

Real-time features such as:

user connections,

dynamic user list updates,

and message sending/receiving

are powered by SignalR and server-rendered Blazor components.

Technically, the application is built using C# and .NET Core 9. Session-based authentication is used to manage user identity without relying on tokens.

This hybrid architecture allows for a smooth transition toward more modern technologies like Blazor, without losing the familiarity and reliability of ASP.NET MVC.

üí° Technologies Used:
ASP.NET Core MVC

Blazor Server (RenderMode.ServerPrerendered)

SignalR (real-time communication)

C#

Razor (.cshtml)

Bootstrap / Tailwind (optional for UI)

Session-based user authentication
